# Displaying-Circles-Squares-and-Diamonds-on-Vga-Using-FPGA
* bulding hardware in FPGA for displaying circles on FPGA 
* Hardware that we build is kind of ASIC for well known Bressnam Circle Drawing Algorithm

* VGA core that we used for vga interfacing was created at the University of Toronto Digital System Design like Course. The
Details on VGA core can be found on University of Torontoâ€™s web page:  https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece241_07F/vga/
