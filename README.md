# Displaying-Circles-Squares-and-Diamonds-on-Vga-Using-FPGA
* bulding hardware in FPGA for displaying circles on FPGA 
* Hardware that we build is kind of ASIC for well known Bressnam Circle Drawing Algorithm

* VGA core that we used for vga interfacing was created at the University of Toronto Digital System Design like Course. The
Details on VGA core can be found on University of Torontoâ€™s web page:  https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jayar/ece241_07F/vga/ 

# Steps to Follow
* Simply Create a Quartus Project (If you are working on intel fpga)
* Then add the VGA Adaptor and verilog .v file (TASK2.v, TASK3.v or TASK4.v depending on Which Task you want to run)
* Explanation on Each TASK is given in Assignment 1 PDF file
* Explanation on FPGA switches and KEYs is given in All Task files at the top of files
